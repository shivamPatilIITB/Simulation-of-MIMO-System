# Simulation-of-MIMO-System

**Resume points:**

Simulation of MIMO System | Python (Decâ€™22)

(a) Developed a simulation of a MIMO receiver, comparing ZF and LMMSE receiver performances

(b) Simulated MIMO capacity for equal vs. optimal power allocation found by using water filling algorithm

(c) Studied Spatial Modulation and a Space Shift Keying system and plotted their BER performance
